 A Federal High Court sitting in Owerri, the Imo State capital, has freed, unconditionally, all 114 women arrested and detained earlier in the week by the state police command whilst on a peaceful protest in demand for the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the acclaimed leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), who has, along with his parents, been missing since Nigerian soldiers allegedly invaded his Umuahia home during the operation Python Dance II of September last year. The women’s continued incarceration had generated condemnations on social media, with many questioning the rationale behind their arrest. The women were remanded by a magistrate’s court in Owerri on Monday and Thursday respectively, after they were arrested and arraigned by the Police. The bail application filed by the lead counsel to the women, Ejiofor Uche, was not opposed, as the Police had no representation in court. The court had granted the bail application, and freed the women unconditionally. The Police prosecutor, Theaddus Okay, told our correspondent that the Police had no representation because the matter had been referred to the state ministry of justice for legal counsel and decision. © 2018, Hallmarknews.
