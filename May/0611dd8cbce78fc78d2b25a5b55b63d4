Egypt forward Mohamed Salah says he is “confident” of being fit for the World Cup after hurting his shoulder playing for Liverpool in the Champions League final. It was a very tough night, but I’m a fighter. Despite the odds, I’m confident that I’ll be in Russia to make you all proud. Your love and support will give me the strength I need. It was 0-0 at the time, and Madrid went on to win 3-1 on Saturday. In a Twitter post on Sunday, Salah said “it was a very tough night, but I’m a fighter. Despite the odds, I’m confident that I’ll be in Russia to make you all proud.” He added, “your love and support will give me the strength I need.” Egypt is playing in the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Its first group game is against Uruguay on June 15. The 25-year-old scored the winning goal against Congo in October to send the North African nation into the Russia tournament. Salah scored 44 goals for Liverpool in all competitions this season. Ramos, who has been accused of deliberately taking out one of Europe’s form players, also took to Twitter, wishing the Liverpool forward a speedy recovery. “Sometimes football shows you it’s good side and other times the bad. Above all, we are fellow pros,” Ramos wrote on Twitter. Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp said he felt the injury was bad luck. “I know if you say something like that after a game you lost, it sounds like you are a little bit a bad loser but it was, for me, kind of a harsh challenge,” Klopp said. “It’s like wrestling a little bit and it’s unlucky than that Mo fell on his shoulder.”
