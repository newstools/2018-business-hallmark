President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, May 31, officially accepted the disengagement of the deputy governor in charge of operations at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Adebayo Adelabu, with effect from July 15, 2018. Daily Independent reports that the president approved the resignation of Adelabu in a letter dated May 24, 2018 and personally signed by him. President Buhari thanked Adelabu for his services to the country and wished him the best in his future ambitions. “While appreciating your services in the Central Bank of Nigeria since 9th April 2014, I wish you the very best in your future ambitions and continued commitment to public service in our country and specifically, as you seek to play a more active role in politics, in your home State,” the letter stated. The report said Adelabu assumed duty as deputy governor at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on April 9, 2014. He then served at different times as deputy governor in charge of Financial System Stability (FSS), Corporate Services (CS), and lastly operations before he tendered his letter of disengagement. It was learnt that the disengagement may be connected with his ambition to contest the governorship of Oyo state in the forthcoming primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
