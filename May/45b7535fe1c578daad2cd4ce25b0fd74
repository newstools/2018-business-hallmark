Alhaji Rasheed Yussuf, the former president of Association of Stock Broking Houses of Nigeria (ASHON), attributed the persistent lull in the stock market to exit of portfolio investors due to political situation. Yussuf said that tense situation in the Middle-Belt and political campaigns contributed to the exit of portfolio investors. He stressed that Nigeria needed foreign investors that were committed to stay on by investing in specific industries. “We need foreign investors but we need the ones that will come and invest in our economy. “What we are seeing are not the ones that want to invest in our economy but the ones that want to play our market. Any negative development, they will exit with their money. They are called speculative investors because they don’t want to take any risk. “They come to your country as soon as they see that the foreign exchange is going down or political situation is tensed, they exit. “The speculative segment of the foreign investors is what we are seeing in the market,’’ Yussuf said.(NAN)
