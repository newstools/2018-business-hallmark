…Dangote still dominates the industry By Okey Onyenweaku Cement manufacturers in the country are on the edge of an unprecedented explosion in product demand as the federal government gets set to heavily increase expenditure on infrastructure as a prelude to convincing voters to give it a second bite at the governance cherry in 2019. To be sure, cement manufacturing in Nigeria has become a goldmine for manufacturers with first mover advantages as competition among top players grows stiffer. The foray of cement companies into other African countries has also attracted huge attention. Three major Cement companies with competitive dominance include Dangote Cement, Lafarge Africa(Wapco) Cement and the Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN). As the three companies go for bigger slices of blossoming market analysts note that Nigerian companies collectively produce over 60million metric tonnes of Cement annually. Dangote produces 45.6million metric tonnes annually, Lafarge has a capacity of 12 million metric tonnes while the BUA group with its subsidiary, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) has a production capacity of 10million metric tonnes. A few smaller companies make up the balance. Corporate finance specialists have noted that despite growing sales prospects the operating performance of the market major behemoths has been mixed. For instance, Dangote Cement performed impressively in the first quarter of 2018, Lafarge recorded a startling loss of N2billion. But the BUA Group which is not listed on the local bourse, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)shows a modest but optimistic result.

Demand for cement was estimated at over 10 million metric tonnes in the year 2006.  This gradually grew to 11 million and 13million tonnes in 2010 and 2015 respectively. Recently, the cement companies have acquired higher production capacities. The cement industry had suffered challenges which include high initial setup costs, High distribution costs and unfavourable Government Policies. Other impediments in the cement industry have been insufficient Local Capacity, Erratic Power Supply, and Technological Inadequacies. However, the sector has the potential to grow if the promises of the new government to commit funds and build massive infrastructure in the country. Managing Director of HIGHCAP Securities Ltd, Mr. David Adonri reckons that Cement industry would benefit from the massive infrastructure projects of the government. ‘’Lafarge Africa’s problem is company specific’’, he said adding that there is a huge market for the cement industry in Africa.
