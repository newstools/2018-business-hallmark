President Muhammadu Buhari has fulfilled his administration’s third  anniversary promise by signing into law, the `Not Too Young To Run Bill’. While signing the bill on Thursday, the president, in a jocular mood, ‘appealed’ to young people to defer their presidential ambitions till after the 2019 general elections. President Buhari, however, noted that the new bill did not tamper with the age qualifications for governor and the senate, which remained at 35. He congratulated the young people over the signing of the bill, and urged them to be more enterprising and self-sustaining.(NAN)
