The Presidency has received the 2018 Appropriation Bill from the National Assembly. The President’s liaison officer to the National Assembly, Senator Ita Enang confirmed that he received the budget from the legislature on Friday and that the consideration of the budget by the President would follow. Senate President Bukola Saraki had told State House correspondents on Thursday that the budget, which was passed by the National Assembly on Wednesday last week, would be forwarded to the President today (Friday). Dr Saraki, who led members of the legislature to the break the day’s fast with President Buhari, had explained that the delay in transmitting the Appropriation Bill to the executive was because both houses of the National Assembly were harmonising their versions.
