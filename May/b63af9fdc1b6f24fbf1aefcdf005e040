The All Progressives Congress (APC) Congress Committee in Oyo State has declared the Ward Congress as peaceful, free and fair. The committee on Monday said reports from the three Senatorial districts controlling 351 wards from 33 local government areas indicate that the Congress was held successfully without any hitch. The leader of the Congress Committee, Musa Halilu-Ahmed told journalists at the party’s secretariat in Oke-Ado, Ibadan, that all the steps taken towards conducting the congress were backed with the laws and regulations set by the party for the exercise. He said any aggrieved individual should submit their misgivings to a special Appeal Committee that just arrived the State to see to such complaints. “I want to inform the media that in the process of conducting the Primary, all our actions were being backed by the law and regulations of our great party. “In politics generally, there are winners and there are losers, and some that naturally will feel they must have it their ways or if they cannot, then all hell must be let loose. You witnessed that on the very day we arrived here, my life and those of my members were threatened. Two of my members got injured but we stood our ground, knowing fully well that this great party can never be disintegrated,” he said. The Appeal Committee led by its Chairman, Binta Muazu has since arrived the state and appealed to those aggrieved by the result of Ward Congress, promising to ensure fear-hearing. “We are here from the national headquarters of our party to see to any grievance that might arise from the last Ward Congress in the State and we are happy to have heard from the Congress Committee that the last exercise was free and fair,” Muazu said. Governor Abiola Ajimobi in response to the outcome of the ward congress said efforts are on to bring together the splintered group in order to enhance peace and progress of the party.
