Commuters in France faced more travel headaches on Thursday as the French rail strikes continued. Nevertheless the industrial action caused far less disruption than when the strikes began in April. Rail timetables were disrupted across the country as rail workers kept up the fight against the government’s overhaul of the SNCF and changes to their workers’ status. One TGV out of two was scheduled to operate, which at a closer look meant three out of five trains were running on the TGV Est line, two out of every five on the TGV Atlantique line. Meanwhile, one out of every three trains were operating on the TGV Nord services and one out of two were running on the TGV Sud-Est services. For those planning to travel on Ouigo trains, three out of five trains were said to be circulating. On international services, three out of five trains were running, with Eurostar and Lyria operating four out of five trains and two out of five trains, respectively. For Thalys trains, the schedule was said to be running almost as normal for the France-Germany route, while SNCF was planning one train in three on the France-Italy route and one out of two trains on the France-Spain route. SNCF has also said that regional services were be disrupted and advises rail users to consult the website to check how the industrial action is affecting their area. Read more here
