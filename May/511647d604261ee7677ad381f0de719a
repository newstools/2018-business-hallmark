Diego Costa appears at the doorway of the Atletico Madrid dressing-room, an hour before kick off. ‘Lads,’ he announces with a big grin. ‘It’s Arsenal.’ Well, he probably didn’t; but he could have. It was one of those nights, those Arsenal nights in Europe. Glimpses of potential but ultimately defeat and disappointment. At the final whistle the players slumped to the ground, crushed. Yet in reality, goalkeeper Jan Oblak made one save, from a shot by defensive midfield player Granit Xhaka. It was not as if Arsenal were unfortunate or expended every last drop of energy. They were still Arsenal. They always wanted one extra touch before crossing, they were always half a yard short of getting a toe to it in the six-yard box. They were just over, they were just wide, they were just…Arsenal.
