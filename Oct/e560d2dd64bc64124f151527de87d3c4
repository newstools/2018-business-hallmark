We also crave for other board appointments beneficial to all Nigerians.” The group said it arrived at the position after due consultations and called on the presidential candidate, Atiku to give due consideration to the demands. “We carefully arrived at this after due deliberations and in view of our undeterred committements to the peaceful cohexistence, unity and progress of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “We hope this will galvernize our people’s support and our target is to deliver over 10 million votes to the PDP. “We hope the PDP as a party and Waziri Atiku Abubakar considers this open window of opportunity with an aggregated signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with representatives of the Southwest, ranging from our elders, sociocultural groups, youths, artisans, professionals, and the Diaspora, and that will be done in the open in the eyes of the world with full press coverage, preferably at our forthcoming Southwest Youth Summit, slated for November, 2018 in Ogun State. “For we feel the urgent need to convince our people on the need to jettison their own, Professor Yemi Oshibajo, the current vice president, but that has to be with the assurance of better alternative, for our people say that ‘a bird at hand is worth two in the bush’.” The group said once the conditions are guaranteed, PDP will record landslide victory in the South West. “With these demands met, the PDP will achieve a landslide victory in the South West.” They nonetheless, restated the zone’s commitment to restructuring and called on the former vice president to see to the restructuring of the country once in power. “Restructuring agenda must be faced head on with the setting up of A National Restructuring Commission with an Executive Bill. “He must be able to summon a greater patriotic will towards building and reviving our dying nation from economic stagnation and social insecurity. “He must be able to implement the 26% UN Budgetary standard allocation to the Education sector with a view to postulating and establishing a statutory priciples of law by enacting the Education Right Bill into law. “He needs to quickly review the land use Act laws into Land Licencing and Allotment Law via Executive Bill, wherein all lands right must revert back to the land owners and communities, while government only regulates its operations and management, and Certificate of Occupancy and Consent should be replaced with Land Certificate of Ownership Licence. “Also, the government must be ready to equip the youths by granting 40% youth affirmative action plan on appointment and involving the Nigerian youths in his government. “A roburst vocational training program in information technology, Agriculture and other ancillary trainings, which will place Nigeria as at par with first world nations. ”Security architecture needs a total overhaul to ensure absolute neutrality in the discharge of statutory duties. “More emphasis should be placed on rebuiding peace and patriotism.
