Meanwhile, Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, President, Association of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the sustained fiscal discipline of the CBN would impact positively on the stability of the naira. Gwadabe said that in spite of the shedding of the external reserves, the CBN was capable of sustaining a stable exchange rate. ” The reasons for the shedding of the external reserve is that the outflows outstrips the inflows as a result of the election year. ”However, due to sustained fiscal discipline of the administration, the scenario will have little or no impact on the sustained exchange rate stability,” Gwadabe said. © 2018, Hallmarknews.
