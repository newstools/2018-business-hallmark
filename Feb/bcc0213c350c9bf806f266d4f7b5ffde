FELIX OLOYDE Nigeria’s full 2017 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report will be out on Tuesday, says Professor Yemi Kale, the country’s Statistician-General. He disclosed this on his twitter handle on Sunday. The country’s GDP stood at 1.4 per cent as at September 2017, but analysts had projected the economy to grow at 1.9 per cent last year, while the government in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (EGRP) forecast 2.2 per cent. It would be recalled that Nigeria plunged into its first recession in 25 years in the first quarter of 2016, but recovered in Q2 2017. The World Bank has projected that Nigeria’s economy would grow 2.1 per cent this year, the EGRP, however, targets 4.8 per cent growth rate.
