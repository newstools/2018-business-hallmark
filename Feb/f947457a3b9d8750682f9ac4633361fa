A plane belonging to Dana Air overshot the runway in Port Harcourt on Tuesday after landing at the Port Harcourt Airport.  The plane had flown to Port Harcourt from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in the nation’s capital Abuja. The General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, Henrietta Yakubu, confirmed the incident. She said, “A Dana aircraft numbered 9J0363, flying from Abuja to Port Harcourt airport has overshot the Port Harcourt runway. “The incident was suspected to have been caused by a heavy rain, which was accompanied by strong wind and storm in Port Harcourt. “No casualty was recorded, as all passengers on board were safely evacuated.” The Communications Manager for the airline, Mr Kingsley Ezenwa, said in a statement the plane “skidded off the runway at the Port Harcourt International Airport, as a result of the bad weather situation and torrential rain at the time of landing”. The airline commended the pilot for how he handled the issue, adding that all passengers and crew disembarked safely. “We commend the Pilot-in-command who was able to control the aircraft to a complete stop, before passengers and crew disembarked,” the statement read in part. “We also wish to applaud the Captain for exhibiting the highest safety standards and handling the situation professionally.”
