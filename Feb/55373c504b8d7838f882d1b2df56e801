The trial of the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, has been adjourned till March 8, 2018, for parties to adopt their final brief.  Although the trial was slated for today, but was however adjourned by the Code of Conduct Tribunal Chairman, Mr Danladi Umar, following claims by the defence lead Counsel, Mr Kanu Agabi, that he was served with the brief of the prosecution on Monday, February 26, 2018. Mr Agabi who led a team of other senior lawyers for the Senate President, pleaded with the tribunal to adjourn the matter to enable him to study and respond to the brief of argument served on him late by the prosecution. However, the prosecutor Mr Rotimi Jacobs admitted that his brief was served late, but blamed the defence for the lateness on the grounds that their own brief of argument was served on him after seven days, ordered by the tribunal. Mr Jacob also told the tribunal that because the defence filed their brief of argument out of time, the settlement of his own brief was affected. Having listened to both sides the tribunal chairman subsequently adjourned the matter to March 8th for the adoption of final written address. Mr Danladi also said that after the formal adoption of the written address, the tribunal will take a date for judgment in the suit which commenced since 2015.
