In a bid to enhance the development of science in the country, the Federal Government has partnered with the Vatican to establish an international standard science centre in Imo State. The Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, stated this in Mbaitoli area of the state over the weekend. “The Federal Government entered into a relationship with the Vatican,” he said during a facility tour on the just-completed science centre. “We are interested that our young people are interested in their studies; to embrace Science and Technology.” According to him, the science centre will soon be inaugurated and will admit students from other parts of Africa. Students will be taught Chemistry, with complementary subject areas in Biology, Physics and Mathematics, according to the minister. The Minister also reiterated the commitment of the Buhari administration to reposition the nation’s technological space to meet global standards. The decision to set up the centre for children from all African countries was influenced by a study conducted by the Vatican. In its findings, the Vatican discovered that the difference between developing and developing countries is the level of Science and Technology, a country embraces. Consequently, the government’s mission is to engage young Africans in studying science and technology aimed at developing the continent that would create jobs, wealth, fight poverty and diseases.
