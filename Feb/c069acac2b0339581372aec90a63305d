President Muhammadu Buhari says the Federal Government is committed to ending the Boko Haram insurgency and other related crimes across the country. The President said this on Thursday in Kaduna where he unveiled a Surveillance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), produced locally by the Nigerian Air Force.  He also said the government is working tirelessly to restore Nigeria on the part of economic prosperity. President Buhari was at the Nigerian Air Force Base, Mando, to inaugurate the drone as part of the government’s effort to tackle insecurity in the country. According to the military, the drone is the first locally made in Nigeria and will help to improve the fight against terrorism and other sophisticated crimes through enhanced air surveillance. The President commended the Nigerian Armed Forces for their breakthrough in science and technology innovation as well as assured them of government’s support in their research projects. In their various remarks, Governor El-Rufai and the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogboonnaya Onu, described the invention as a milestone and part of the Federal Government’s drive to encourage local content. Also addressing the gathering, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, said the development would help to discourage the military’s over-dependence on developed nations for the supply of security equipment. He added that the main objective of producing the surveillance vehicle was to instil self-sufficiency in the fields of aviation and military technology. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle has been designed to meet vast expectations and needs and could be used by the military and other security agencies for both internal and external security operations. The 40-kilogramme drone is also fashioned to pick objects 10,000 feet above sea level. Its history began in 2007 when the Nigerian Air Force introduced a five-year manpower development programme in Aerospace Engineering.
