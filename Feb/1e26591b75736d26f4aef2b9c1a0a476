President Muhammadu Buhari has rejected bill for the establishment of a paramilitary outfit, Peace Corps of Nigeria. The president’s rejection was conveyed in a letter read by Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara during House plenary on Tuesday. The president gave security concerns as well as financial burden of funding the organisation as some of the reasons for rejecting the bill. He noted given scarce government resources, funding the organisation will be a financial burden on the federal government. The national assembly passed the bill in 2017, after a prolonged battle involving the organisation and the nation’s security agencies. The Cable recalled that the Peace Corps of Nigeria has been involved in various controversies since the bill came to limelight at the national assembly. There are litigations currently pending before the court between Dickson Akoh, the organisation’s commandant, and the Nigeria police force. The national assembly passed the bill in 2017, after a prolonged battle involving the organisation and the nation’s security agencies. The organisation’s premises has also been cordoned off since last year by policemen, despite a court judgement and a directive from the house of representatives asking the police to vacate the premises. On Tuesday, the Akoh and Ibrahim Idris, inspector-general of police, are expected to appear before a house of representatives committee investigating the dispute between the police and the organisation.
