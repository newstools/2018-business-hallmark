OBINNA EZUGWU  Chief Goddy Uwazurike, president emeritus of Aka Ikenga has described the late Biafra war hero, Col. Joseph Achuzie as a titanic war leader who never tolerated cowards and was known to pull his gun on any deserter. Achuzie who died on February 26, 2018 at age 89 in Asaba, Delta State, was noted for his exploits during the Nigeria/Biafra war which lasted from 1967 to 1970. His death, according to Chief Uwazurike is a great loss to Ndigbo. “Achuzie was a titanic war leader. He was a commander who did not tolerate cowards,” Uwazurike said. “Indeed, in Biafra, he was known for pulling his gun on any deserter.” “He was such a fanatical leader that his troops believed bullets could not kill him, and truly they did not kill him. To the average Igbo person, Achuzia was a demon in battle. “He could have run away at the end of the war, but he did not,” he noted. Achuzie was born in 1929. He lived in his home town of Asaba since he was released from prison in 1970 and until his death, was vociferous in matters of Biafra and Ndigbo in Nigeria.
