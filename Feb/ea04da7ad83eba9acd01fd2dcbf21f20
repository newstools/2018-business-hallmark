Banks and discount houses with non-performing loans above 10 per cent will no longer be allowed to pay dividends to their shareholders.  The Central Bank of Nigeria gave the directive as part of measures to curb the increase in non-performing loans and to stop further erosion of the capital base of the banks. The directive comes about a week to the release of the 2017 financial year’s annual reports by commercial banks and discount houses in the country. Data from the apex bank puts the banking industry’s non-performing loans at 15.18 per cent as at September 2017.  Meanwhile, transactions in the fixed income and currency markets declined to N11.71 trillion in January 2018, from N11.86 trillion in December 2017.
