 By OBINNA EZUGWU Apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has demanded an unconditional release of Senator Enyinnaya Harcourt Abaribe, insisting that the onus lies on the country’s security forces who invaded the Umuahia home of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu to produce him. This was contained in a statement on Friday by Ohanaeze President-General, Dr. John Nnia Nwodo. The Ohanaeze leader  noted that it was the “warlike” invasion of Kanu’s home that led to his disappearance, while regretting that the judiciary was toeing the path of the executive by throwing the law overboard in matters affecting the South East. “The circumstances prevailing at the time of the disappearance of Nnamdi Kanu are beyond the contemplation of the law that a surety can guarantee the production of an accused person,” Nwodo said. “The army in the name of “Operation Python Dance” invaded Nnamdi’s home and destabilized normalcy there. “It is only the security agency that can disclose Nnamdi’s whereabout.
Senator Abaribe has no capacity, nor has any surety in the circumstances to know the whereabouts of Nnamdi Kanu. “What happened in Umahia was an invasion, a war of a kind. Nnamdi may have been killed or captured in the imbroglio or even escaped into hiding. “The onus lies on the security forces to disclose his whereabout. “The judiciary is beginning to tow the line of the executive by throwing the law overboard in matters that affect the South East. “We are all equal before the law. Senator Abaribe must be released forthwith,” he concluded. Senator Abaribe, representing Abia South was arrested in the early hours of Friday by the DSS.
