The bye-election that was held in 140 polling units in all 10 wards across the constituency was necessitated followed the death of Michael Adeyemo, the occupant of the seat in the State House of Assembly, on April 27. In his remark at the end of the election, Mr Adedeji Soyebi, the National Electoral Commissioner for Oyo, Osun and Ekiti, said the election was successful and gave kudos to the people of the constituency for conducting themselves peacefully. ” We have little issue with card readers unlike previous elections because we used enhanced smart card readers now” Soyebi noted. He also commended security personnel deployed to the area for their efforts toward peaceful and violence free exercise. The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) who monitored the bye election in Eruwa and Lanlate towns reports that there was heavy presence of security operatives led by Mr Abiodun Odude, the Oyo state commissioner of police. Polling officials and election materials arrived early in all polling units while accreditation and voting started timely and smoothly with the use of effective card readers in all the polling units visited. Only three agents of Accord, APC and PDP were present at every polling unit visited in Lanlate and Eruwa, though seven political parties participated in the bye election . The turnout of voters, however, was low at ward 6, polling units 001 – 005, Sango area, LA primary school , ward 05, polling units 001-006 and other polling units visited.

Mrs Abigael Folorunsho, the PDP agent at unit 002, ward 05, Eruwa, Mrs Abigael Folorusho, attributed the low turnout to fear of being attacked as earlier rumoured that the election would be violent.
