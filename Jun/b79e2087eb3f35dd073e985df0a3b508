A former member of the House of Representatives, Opeyemi Bamidele, and another party loyalist have been shot. The incident occurred on Friday in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, as a result of an accidental discharge. The victims were hit by the bullets during the takeoff campaign of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Kayode Fayemi. APC chairman in the state, Mr Jide Awe, confirmed the incident to Channels Television. He, however, noted that the victims have been rushed to the hospital. The party chairman claimed that the shooting was aimed at Fayemi, although Bamidele accidentally fell victim of the shot. “When he shot at the crowd, I believe sincerely that he (the police) aimed at Dr Kayode Fayemi but narrowly, he (Fayemi) was pushed by somebody walking behind him,” Mr Awe revealed during a telephone interview on Politics Today. “Opeyemi Bamidele was equally very near him and the shot hit him. But I can say authoritatively that he’s not badly hit, and he is recovering as we are talking,” he added. The APC chairman, who witnessed the incident, noted that those at the scene thought the shot was fired by an overzealous officer who was trying to pay respect to the former minister. He said was just returning from the hospital and proceeding to another medical facility where the other gunshot victim was being attended to. Meanwhile, the police authorities in the state have confirmed the incident and noted that they have begun an investigation into the shooting. The incident happened two days after Dr Fayemi resigned his position from President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet as the Minister of Solid Minerals Development. He resigned two weeks and some days after the former minister won the APC rescheduled primary election which held on May 12.
