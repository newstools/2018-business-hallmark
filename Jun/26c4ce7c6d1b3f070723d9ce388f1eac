By OKEY ONYENWEAKU Contrary to investor expectations the Oil and Gas sector of the local stock market is failing to provide the market with the boost needed to shake it out of a bearish rut. Indeed, the sector seems to be in a depressed mood that even global oil price increases have found difficult to dislodge as stock prices of large-tier oil marketers drop like pins from a leaky pocket. After five months of activity the sector has shown major weakness. As at the close of business last week June 7, 2018, the sector showed tepid growth. Not even acrude oilprice of $76.39(62 per cent above the 2018 budget benchmark price of $47 per barrel) could turn the sectors frown into a smile. The oil and gas sector, according to the markets main board, gained 3.12 per centyear-to-date yield which is a far cry from the 42 per cent total market yield posted at the end of 2017. However, a sector like the banking sector has sprinted ahead nicely edgingpast the oil and Gas sector which is considered to be the main revenue stay of the country. While the All Share Index (ASI) gained 2.09 per cent, the banking sector chalked upa nifty 3.2 per cent, while the Insurance sector racked in a 0.32 per cent gain. On the flipside, the Consumer Goods sector lost -9.05 per cent of its value,as the Industrial index pulled off a fairly decent 2.6 per cent improvement.

Companies in the oil and gas sector include; Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc, Conoil Plc, Forte Oil Plc, MRs Oil Plc, Total Plc and 11 Plc. While majority of the oil and Gas companies have attracted substantial capital gains, shareholders of a few of them are licking their wounds, due to loses.

Analysts believe that the general weakness of the economy in Nigeria is not favourable to any sector. Apart from the apprehension in the market, foreign investors have also pulled out a substantial part of their funds from the market for fear of deeper losses. Many observers think there is huge uncertainty in the air given the coming 2019 election. Whereas the Nigerian currency ‘the Naira’ is weakening against other currencies of the globe, Broad street analysts blame the crunch in the economy as the major challenge in the market. The development may have put pressure on the market which has further been weakened by investor apathy and lack of confidence. Managing Director of Crane Securities & Investment limited, Mr. Mike Ezeh, reckons that low demand for stocks generally, induced by lack of money is also affecting Petroleum Marketing shares. He explained that with limited funds investors would prefer to buy shares which values are lower than oil and gas shares with higher prices. David Adonri of Lambeth Trust & Investment Limited believes that in addition to low trading, the Petroleum stocks lack liquidity. A big investor, Mr. Fred Nwaogazi, thinks that the Petroleum Marketing companies are only down -stream players and mainly importers of fuel, adding that they cannot benefit from the oil windfall since they are not main-stream participants.
