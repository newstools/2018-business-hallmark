According to Bloomberg report, preparations are in the final stages to begin the sale of the companies in industries that range from power through aviation to insurance, Joe Anichebe, director, Bureau of Public Enterprises, said in an interview on Saturday in the southwestern city of Abeokuta. Two of them, Nicon Insurance Ltd. and Skyway Aviation Handling Co. will be sold “this month or early next month” through an initial public offering, he said.

The privatization agency had pledged to raise N306 billion to help finance the planned spending. The agency sold a 21 percent stake in the state-owned mint to the central bank last week for 17.3 billion naira, according to Anichebe. It is also reviewing previous sales and plans to revoke deals where buyers haven’t kept to their agreements, he said. © 2018, Hallmarknews. All rights reserved.
