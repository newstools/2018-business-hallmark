By OLUSESAN LAOYE The comptroller of Nigeria Customs Service for Oyo and Osun Command, Comptroller Christopher Ogar Odibu, has said that the Nigerian Customs has re–strategized to deal decisively with smugglers and increase the revenue profile of the service especially that of the Oyo and Osun State command under him. He gave this hint while displaying various smuggled goods seized by his command   at the Customs barracks in Ijokodo area of Ibadan. Comptroller Odibu who warned smugglers in his command to relocate and look for other means of livelihood and business said that he would not take smuggling lightly  as he was determined to deal with   smugglers as they have spread all their tentacles across the borders within  Oyo  and Osun  states. He said despite the efforts of the Nigerian Government to discourage smuggling activities and transform the agricultural sector, especially in the area of rice production, some Nigerians still remain adamant and unrepentant. He pointed out that the Nigerian federal government is doing everything to encourage people to grow rice and as well discourage the importation of rice. He therefore sounded a note of warning to them and advised all unrepentant Nigerians who engage in smuggling of used cars, foreign rice and other contra banned goods to desist from it and look for other legitimate means of businesses. He affirmed that no matter the level of conveyance or concealment of prohibited goods by the perpetrators, ‘’ I assure you that the officers of this command are on constant surveillance and monitoring and we would discover them.’’ The goods seized by the area command include one used yellow colour Leyland DAF truck with registration number MUS 461XK carrying 450 bags of (50kg)imported rice, one used gold colour DAF truck with registration NumberEKY597Xv carrying 450 bags of (50kg) bags of rice , one used white colour DAF Truck with registration number EGB 530XA carrying450 of 50kg bags of rice, one blue DAF truck with registration number AGL 944XC carrying 330bags of rice, one used white  DAF 65 truck with registration number SMK 226 XR carrying 400 bags of rice, and another green DAF  75 truck carrying450 bags of smuggled rice.

He then put the total duty payable value of all the items at N92, 778,048.22 According to him, the seizures were made at different locations within the command’s area of coverage especially along Oparabodo Musa axis of Iwajowa local government Area of Oyo State, saying that one suspect has been arrested along with the seized goods. He pointed out that so far, the command is prosecuting many cases at the Federal High court in Ibadan Oyo State, saying that the increase in the smuggling of rice and other items is seasonal depending on the climate. On why Nigerians still smuggled rice despite the assurance by the Nigerian Government, on this, Comptroller Odibu posited that there was no need for illegal smuggling of goods because in the case of rice, government did not place total ban on it saying that what it did was to ban land border smuggliung because the government wants whoever wants to import rice particularly to do this through the sea ports while the importers are expected to be licensed. He said the Government has put every measure in place to ensure smooth importations of goods but because Nigerians are used to cutting corner they would not obey. ‘’As  far as we are concerned, Nigeria with the rate of legal importations have enough rice to consume but because people are dirty and would not want to obey the laws, that is why they still engage in smuggling at the detriment of others and their country’’
