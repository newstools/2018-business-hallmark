Following conflicting figures of missing students as a result of the invasion, the Federal Government confirmed that 110 girls were unaccounted for after the incident. Amid calls from Nigerians and international bodies, including the United Nations and the United States for the rescue of the missing girls, President Buhari explained what his administration was doing to ensure their safe return. He had also said the life of every Nigerian was important and vowed that the government would ensure the release of all citizens in the captivity of the outlawed group. While the herdsmen-farmers crisis and Boko Haram attacks have claimed several lives, the Presidency announced on March 5 that the President would be visiting some of the states affected by the killings. He had visited Taraba (on Monday last week) and Benue (on March 12) where he condoled with families of those who lost their lives. States yet to be visited by the President are Zamfara and Rivers.
