The Senate President through his spokesman Yusuph Olaniyonu, expressed shock over the death of the Senator. “Senator as a vibrant lawmaker and public servant who was very passionate about his assignment and engagements in the Senate, especially his Chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Poverty Alleviation and other committees where he was a member. “Mallam Ali Wakili is one lawmaker you can never be in doubt where he stands on a particular issue. “He spoke his mind fearlessly, his contributions at plenary were always very incisive and rich. I find it difficult to acknowledge that he will not resume plenary with us next Tuesday.” “My heart goes out to his family, the 8th Senate and the government and people of Bauchi State over the loss of this conscientious and patriotic Nigerian. He shall be sorely missed,” he added. He has since visited the residence of the Senator in Abuja where he commiserated with his immediate and extended family members.
