Just days after the Super Eagles concluded the first phase of their 2018 FIFA World Cup actual build –up with useful encounters against Poland in Wroclaw and Serbia in London, and the U20 boys concluded a two –match tour of the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Senior Women’s Team, Super Falcons are also having a good kick with a prestige friendly against France. The eight –time African champions are up against their French counterparts at the Stade MMArena in the city of Le Mans, France on Friday, 6th April 2018. Coach Thomas Dennerby, whose maidens composed entirely of home –based professionals took third place at the WAFU Women Cup of Nations in Abidjan in February following penalty shoot-out defeat by Ghana in the semi finals, will have the complement of foreign –based gladiators as well when they pitch battle with France as from 9pm on Friday next week.
