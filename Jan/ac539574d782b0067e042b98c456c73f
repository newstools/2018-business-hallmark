By Obinna Ezugwu Parents of the of slain members of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) have disrupted the ongoing meeting between Yoruba Socio-cultural Afenifere group, Afenifere and their Igbo counterparts, Ohanaeze Ndigbo holding in Enugu. The parents who heckled Ohanaeze president, Nnia Nwodo while he was speaking, blamed Ohanaeze and other Igbo leaders for keeping quiet while their sons are being killed by the Nigerian security forces. The hall of the event became rowdy for minutes before things were brought under reasonable control and PA Ayo Adebanjo continued with his address. While Adebanjo spoke however, there were occasional jeers from the a section of the crowd suspected to have be sponsored by a certain group not keen on the unity of the Igbo and Yoruba.
