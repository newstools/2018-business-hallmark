By Obinna Ezugwu Second Republic senator, Professor Banji Akintoye has lamented that the lack of unity between the Igbo and the Yoruba has put both groups in a situation where they have gradually become slaves to those they are better than in every aspect of life. Prof Akintoye who was speaking at a unity meeting between the two ethnic groups in Enugu, Thursday, said each time he went overseas, he is asked why the Igbo and Yoruba have continued to allow themselves to be dominated and used at will by the North. He explained that before the passing on of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, he called him and told him that the only way Nigeria could move forward, was for the Igbo and the Yoruba to come together, and unity between the two groups must be pursued. Prof Akintoye however, expressed happiness that the unity Awolowo spoke about is coming to pass and assured that he will do all within his powers to make sure it is sustained. He called on all and sundry to work towards the unity as the future of the country was dependent on it.
