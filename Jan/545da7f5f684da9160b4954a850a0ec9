Former Minister of Aviation, Mr. Femi Fani-Kayode was the center of attention at the event organised to foster unity between the Igbo, the Yoruba as well as South South and Middle Belt in Enugu. A section of the crowd, mostly peopled by sympathizers of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) who had earlier heckled both the president of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Nnia Nwodo and Afenifere chieftain, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, went into wild celebrations when the former minister was called upon to speak. Throughout his speech, Fani-Kayode who adorned in Igbo attire, was roundly hailed byÂ  a greater section of the capacity hall at the Base Event Centre, Independent Layout, Enugu. In his speech, the vocal former minister asked President Muhammadu Buhari to tell Nigerians where he kept Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the IPOB, while insisting that Nigeria must be restructured. Lamenting the loss of Igbo lives before, during and after the civil war, as well as Yoruba during the June 12, 1993 struggle and the peoples of the Middle Belt in the hands of those he called the hegemonic Northern feudalistis, he said Nigeria must be restructured to ensure equity and fairness. He warned those opposing restructuring that it was either they accept to have it done in peace, or it would be done by force.
